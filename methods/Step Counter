A pedometer treats walking 1 step as walking 2.5 feet. Define a method named feetToSteps 
that takes a double as a parameter, representing the number of feet walked, and returns an 
integer that represents the number of steps walked. Then, write a main program that reads 
the number of feet walked as an input, calls method feetToSteps() with the input as an 
argument, and outputs the number of steps.

     If the input is:    the output is:
      150.5                60

import java.util.Scanner;

public class LabProgram {
   
   public static int feetToSteps(double feet){    //importanto return int
      double steps = feet / 2.5;                  // takes in double 
      return (int) steps;
   }
      
   
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);      
      double feet = scnr.nextDouble();
      int steps = feetToSteps(feet);
      System.out.println(steps);  
   }
}
