# Java Practice Labs
This repository contains small Java practice labs and exercises that I completed to improve my Java programming skills. 
Each lab focuses on a specific concept, such as object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms, or file I/O.

**The purpose is to:**

    Practice Java programming and problem-solving skills  
    Reinforce understanding of Java concepts  
    Keep a record of learning progress

**Repository Structure:**

    Smallest Number of 3: Write a program whose inputs are three integers, and whose output is the smallest of the three values.
    Interstate highway numbers: Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway.
    Exact change: Write a program with total change amount in pennies as an integer input, and output the change using the fewest coins.
