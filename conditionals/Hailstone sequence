/* The following rules will always create a sequence that ends with 1, called the hailstone sequence:
  If n is even, divide it by 2
  If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 (i.e. 3n +1)
  Continue until n is 1
Write a program that reads an integer as input and prints the hailstone sequence starting with the integer
entered. 
Format the output so that ten integers, each separated by a tab character (\t), are printed per line.  */
