/* Interstate Highway Numbers
Primary U.S. interstate highways are numbered 1-99. 
Odd numbers (like the 5 or 95) go north/south, and evens (like the 10 or 90) go east/west. 
Auxiliary highways are numbered 100-999, and service the primary highway indicated by the rightmost two digits. 
Note: 200 is not a valid auxiliary highway because 00 is not a valid primary highway number.
Given a highway number, indicate whether it is a primary or auxiliary highway. 
If auxiliary, indicate what primary highway it serves. 
Also indicate if the (primary) highway runs north/south or east/west. */
